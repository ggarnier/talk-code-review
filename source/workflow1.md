Adding code reviews to your workflow

TODO: replace with image

- Nobody can commit directly to master
- Create a branch for each feature/bugfix
- After finishing code and tests, request a code review
- pull request (github), merge request (gitlab)
- wait for reviews
- discussions/fixes
- integrate when approved
