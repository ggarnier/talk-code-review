<!-- does the code do what it’s supposed to do? -->
<!-- doesn’t it introduce new bugs (like not handling corner cases)? -->
<!-- is it clear on its intentions? Can a reader clearly understand the coder’s objectives? -->
<!-- could it handle the expected load? -->
<!-- does it follow the agreed conventions for code style, file and directory structure, etc? -->
<!-- do the tests cover all the use cases, including important corner cases? Is there a specific use case that deserves more tests? -->
