## Code review checklist

- **Scalability:** could it handle the expected load?
- **Conventions and standards:** does it follow the agreed conventions for code style, file and directory structure, etc?
- **Tests:** do the tests cover all the use cases, including important corner cases? Is there a specific use case that deserves more tests?
